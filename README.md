## About

This is my implementation of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges using PureScript - 
a language I'm wishing to learn through this exercise.

### Built With

- [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/)
- [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago)
- [purs-tidy](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-tidy)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Installing Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago)

### Installation

First install PureScript packages using Spago:
```bash
npm run spago install
```

Then either build with: 
```bash
npm run build
```

Or run the program:
```bash
npm run run
```

## Usage

After running the program you should see results of challenges printed out.

## Project assistance

If you'd like to provide some input, code review or feedback, that would be very appreciated! I'd love
to learn something new ðŸ’ª
